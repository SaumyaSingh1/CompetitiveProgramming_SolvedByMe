Binary Tree Paths
Given a binary tree. Return all root to leaf paths. You can return the paths in any order. Note: A leaf is a node with no children. For Example
Input 1:
                57
               /  \
              77  76
             / \ 
            21  16
Output 1:
    [   [57, 76]
        [57, 77, 16]
        [57, 77, 21]    ] 

Input 2:
                1
               / \
              2   3
             / \  / \
            4   5 6  7
Output 2:
     [  [1, 2, 4]
        [1, 2, 5]
        [1, 3, 6]
        [1, 3, 7]    ]
